# 🏃‍♂️ DUDE RUNNER - Project Report

## 1. Introduction
**Dude Runner** is a web-based endless runner game built using the **Phaser 3** framework and **JavaScript**. The game features a hero character running through dynamic environments (Chennai-themed), avoiding obstacles, and collecting mangoes. It includes multiple levels, progressive difficulty, and audio feedback.

## 2. Project Structure
The project follows a standard web game directory structure:

## 3. Game Flow & Mechanics

### **Phase 1: Start Screen**
- **State**: Game is paused.
- **UI**: Displays Game Logo and "Press SPACE to Play".
- **Interaction**: Pressing SPACE or Clicking starts the game loop.

### **Phase 2: Level 1 (Chennai Morning)**
- **Environment**: Day Sky, Beach/Sand Ground `bg_ground`.
- **Obstacles**: 
  - **Barricades**: Jump over them.
  - **Metro Trains**: Larger obstacles.
- **Audio**: Plays `bg_audio.mp3`.
- **Progression**: Score increases with distance. Mangoes increase count.

### **Phase 3: Level Transition**
- **Trigger**: When **Distance Score >= 2500m**.
- **Effect**: Screen Flashes White (Camera Fade).
- **Action**: 
  - Background textures swap to Level 2 assets.
  - Game Speed increases (+100).
  - BGM1 stops, **BGM2** starts playing.

### **Phase 4: Level 2 (Sunset Highway)**
- **Environment**: Sunset Sky `bg_sky2`, Road/Highway Ground `bg_ground2`.
- **Obstacles**:
  - **Cars**: Fast, low obstacles.
  - **Bikes**: Smaller obstacles.
- **Difficulty**: Higher speed, tighter obstacle generation.

### **Phase 5: Game Over**
- **Trigger**: Collision with any obstacle.
- **UI**: "GAME OVER" overlay appears.
- **Action**: Game pauses. Click/Press Key to Restart (reloads scene).

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### **Core Technology**
- **Engine**: Phaser 3 (Arcade Physics).
- **Physics**: Gravity-based platformer physics.
- **Input**: Keyboard (Space/Up) and Touch/Mouse.

### **Key Algorithms**
1.  **Infinite Scrolling**: Backgrounds are `TileSprites` that scroll based on `gameSpeed`.
2.  **Procedural Generation**: 
    - `spawnObstacle()` function runs on a randomize timer.
    - Logic decides obstacle type based on Current Level (Metro vs Car).
3.  **Adaptive Asset Management**:
    - **Optimization**: Assets were resized using Python (Pillow) to ensure optimal memory usage and hitbox alignment.
    - **Normalization**: Hero sprite was normalized to fix "floating" issues.

## 5. How to Run
Due to browser security policies (CORS), checking assets from a local file system is restricted.

**Recommended Method:**
1.  Double-click `play_game.bat`.
2.  This starts a local Python HTTP server and opens the game in your default browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Alternative:**
- Open with VS Code Live Server.
